First of all, I want to say thanks. thank you, [toutiao](http://toutiao.io). The great website & App help me a lot to learn programming and get latest news of IT. :)

Second, this repo is just one of my homework(I assign it to myself for interesting). I don't mean to stole their data. So I cannot guarantee that the repo still work well or the return set is correct in future.

Anyway, for now, I can make a schedule that running below command everyday in the last hour to fetch posts from [the website](http://toutiao.io)
